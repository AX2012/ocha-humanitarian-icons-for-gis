# OCHA Humanitarian Icons for use in GIS
These icons were originally created as graphics by The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian affairs (OCHA). MapAction converted these files into True Type Fonts, ESRI Stylesheets and QGIS symbology to allow people working in GIS to use the icons in their work.
